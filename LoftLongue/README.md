### Programmed Components:
```
* This project has been postponed. I need to get a new loft design that's large, but not massive enough to lag. *
- Dancing GUI, users can click 'Dance' to pop out the module and pick a dance.
- Level and money system, every minute user will gain a level and some money. Money has no specific purpose at the moment.
- NPCs that are interactive with dialogs and dancing in the loop.
