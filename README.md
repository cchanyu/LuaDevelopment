### Lua Development GitHub
```
This is the master folder for my Lua projects, many of which are made inside Roblox Studios engine.
These games are live and accessible through Roblox website. The source codes will be accessible within the Roblox Studios.
Roblox is a video game that supports multiplayers and allow student coders like me to develop games at ease.
They have pre-configured set ups within their Studios, however these could be changed with lua scripts.
